# Web Performance Playbook for Service Businesses

Most service websites lose leads because the first screen loads slowly and the CTA is delayed.

## Prioritize the first 3 seconds

- Keep your hero section lightweight.
- Preload only critical assets.
- Defer non-essential JavaScript.

## Optimize images with intent

Use modern formats such as AVIF and WebP, and provide responsive sizes for every breakpoint.

## Measure after each release

Track LCP, CLS and INP after every deployment to prevent regressions.

When performance becomes part of your release process, conversion improves naturally.
