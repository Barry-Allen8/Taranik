# AI Automation Roadmap in 6 Weeks

AI projects fail when teams skip process mapping and KPI definition.

## Week 1-2: Process discovery

Document repetitive workflows and estimate current cost in hours.

## Week 3-4: MVP assistant

- Connect one data source.
- Add approval checkpoints.
- Keep a human-in-the-loop path.

## Week 5-6: Controlled rollout

Deploy to one department first, compare KPI baseline vs. new results, then scale.

A narrow scope and measurable targets reduce risk and improve adoption.
